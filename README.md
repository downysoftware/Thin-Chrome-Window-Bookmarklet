# Thin Chrome Window Bookmarklet

Adapted from the HTML form [here](https://brianshim.com/webtricks/chrome-browser-window-that-you-can-make-narrow/)

Copy-and-paste this code into the "URL" field of an existing bookmark.
```
javascript:void%20function(){void%20open(%22window.location.href%22,%22targetname%22,%22height=800,width=337,resizable=1,scrollbars=1,status=0,toolbar=1,location=1,menubar=0%22)}();
```

It seems bookmarklet links cannot be embedded in Github markup.
