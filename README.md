# Thin Chrome Window Bookmarklet

Adapted from the HTML form [here](https://brianshim.com/webtricks/chrome-browser-window-that-you-can-make-narrow/)

Copy-and-paste this code into the "URL" field of an existing bookmark.
```
javascript:void(open(window.location.href,'targetname','height=800,width=337,resizable=1,scrollbars=1,status=0,toolbar=1,location=1,menubar=0'))
```

It seems bookmarklet links cannot be embedded in Github markup.
